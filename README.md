# Snake Game

## Description
The Snake Game is a popular game which has a special place in my heart ever since I encountered it on a Nokia 3100. This is my first CS  project. I attempted to keep the game as simple and close to the original snake game as possible. 

## Setup
The snake game works well on Python 2.7 and requires Pygame to be installed. 
Additionally, sound effect files (.wav) can be downloaded from '[sound effects.zip](sound effects.zip)' if running '[snakey.py](snakey.py)'.

## Key Learnings
* one of my biggest challenges was getting the movement of the snake right
* understanding Pygame syntax
* how to improve the game after getting the basic algorithm right
