# Snake Game üêçüéÆ

## Description
The Snake Game is an iconic game that has a special place in my heart ever since I had first encountered it on a Nokia 3100. I was interested in building a simple game for a long time and so here's my attempt at making the famous snake game. I wanted to keep it as simple and close to the original game as possible. This is also my first CS project ever. I have a few months of experience with Python and no prior experience with Pygame. It took me a little over a day to code the entire thing. 

## Installation
The snake game works on Python 2.7+ and requires Pygame to be installed (can be done easily by pip). 
Additionally, sound effect files (.wav) can be downloaded if running the final version '[snakey.py](snakey.py)'.

## Game Rules
* The snake (snakey) moves on pressing the 4 arrow keys of the keyboard 
* The aim of the game is to eat the red food particles by moving towards it
* On eating a food particle, snakey gets bigger
* Snakey should stay within the boundaries of the screen

## Key Learnings
* One of my biggest challenges was getting the movement of the snake right - it took a while to append the snake correctly and I had to run the code several times to understand how to change the coordinates
* Understanding Pygame syntax
* How to improve the game after getting the basic algorithm right - after having gotten the main part of the game right, it was much easier to do things such as creating boundaries, adding sound effects, etc.
